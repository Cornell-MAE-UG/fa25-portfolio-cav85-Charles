## About Me

My website is {{ <site.Charles> }}, and I am an undergraduate studying mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell Univisersity. I'm particularly interested in propulsion of aircraft and spacecraft as well as dynamical analysis of aerospace vehicles. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/fa25-portfolio-cav85-Charles/_pages/projects.md" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/fa25-portfolio-cav85-Charles/_pages/cv.md" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
