For the final project of our introductory fluid mechanics class (MAE 3230), groups were assigned an everyday device to take apart and analyze the fluid mechanical components to understand why it was designed as such. Our group was assgined a lawn mower to take apart. We decided to focus our analysis on the engine of the lawn mower since we believed that was where the most interesting components of the engine were.

Within the engine, our group found several useful fluid mechanical components such as fuel lines(pipes) that store transport fuel, inlet and outlet butterfly valves that respond due to pressure, a carburetor, a centrifugal blower that cools engine and a spark plug. We focused our analysis down to the carburetor since we thought it was the fluid mechanical component that was the most interesting to analyze. We created a video overviewing our analysis which can be found through this link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YU2uvIFEm8. Our analysis involved taking measurements of carburetor dimensions to analyze the pressure vacuum that draws in fuel into the carburetor to create air-fuel mixture for the combustion chamber.
