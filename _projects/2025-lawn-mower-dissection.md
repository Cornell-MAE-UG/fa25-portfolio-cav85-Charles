For the final project of our introductory fluid mechanics class (MAE 3230), groups were assigned an everyday device to take apart and analyze the fluid mechanical components to understand why it was designed as such. Our group was assgined a lawn mower to take apart. We decided to focus our analysis on the engine of the lawn mower since we believed that was where the most interesting components of the engine were.

Within the engine, our group found several useful fluid mechanical components such as fuel lines(pipes) that store transport fuel, inlet and outlet butterfly valves that respond due to pressure, a carburetor, a centrifugal blower that cools engine and a spark plug. We focused our analysis down to the carburetor since we thought it was the fluid mechanical component that was the most interesting to analyze. We created a video overviewing our analysis which can be found through this link here:[Dissection Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YU2uvIFEm8). Our analysis involved taking measurements of carburetor dimensions to analyze the pressure vacuum that draws in fuel into the carburetor to create air-fuel mixture for the combustion chamber.

I assisted in the dissection by detaching the engine from the lawn mower and helping to take off the filter cage. For the analysis of the carburetor, I took measurements for key parts of the carubretor, which includes: throttle valve diameter, choke valve side lengths and venturi diameter. These dimensions were usesd to estimate the area at different sections of the carburetor's venturi which was important for analysis of the pressure drop inside the carburetor. My contribution to the video presentation was explaining the roll of the carburetor and outlining important equations and assumptions for our analysis of the carburetor as a fluid mechanical device.
